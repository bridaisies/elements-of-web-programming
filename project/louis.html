                <h1>Louis Tomlinson</h1>
                <p>
                        Louis William Tomlinson was born on December 24th, 1991 in Doncaster, England to Troy Austin and Johannah Deakin. As a student, he took acting lessons and performed in several school productions, sparking his interest in performing. In 2010, Louis auditioned for The X Factor singing “Hey There Delilah” by Plain White T’s. Although he was rejected as a solo artist, judges Simon Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger grouped Louis with four other competitors - Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, and Liam Payne - to finish off the competition as a new group called One Direction. Louis went on to enjoy immense success with One Direction, releasing five albums from 2011 to 2015 and hitting number one multiple times across the globe before parting for an indefinite hiatus in 2016. Louis then started his own solo record label, and released “Just Hold On”, a tribute to his mother, who had passed away to leukemia three days prior to the release. In July 2017, “Back to You” was released as Louis’ debut solo single, which reached the top 10 in the UK. He released two more singles that year, “Just Like You” and “Miss You”, which reached moderate success. In 2018, Louis became a judge on The X Factor, and won the series with his contestant Dalton Harris. Most recently, his debut solo album “Walls” was released in January 2020, which received mixed reviews but performed well nonetheless. Louis also confirmed he is working on his second solo album.
