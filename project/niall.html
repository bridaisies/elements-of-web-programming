                <h1>Niall Horan</h1>
                <p>
                        Niall James Horan was born on September 13th, 1993 in Mullingar, Ireland. He learned guitar at the age of eleven and performed in shows around his hometown. In 2010, at sixteen years old, he auditioned for THe X Factor with the song “So Sick” by Ne-Yo. Although he was rejected as a solo artist, judges Simon Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger grouped Niall with four other competitors - Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles, and Liam Payne - to finish off the competition as a new group called One Direction. Niall went on to enjoy immense success with One Direction, releasing five albums from 2011 to 2015 and hitting number one multiple times across the globe before parting for an indefinite hiatus in 2016. Niall then released his debut single, “This Town” as his first song as a solo artist. The song became a top 10 single worldwide, and was followed by his second single, “Slow Hands”, a commercial success worldwide. In 2017, Niall released his debut album, Flicker, and his third solo single “Too Much to Ask”. His fourth and final Flicker single “On The Loose” was released in 2018, and followed by his debut arena tour - Flicker World Tour. Most recently, Niall’s second album Heartbreak Weather was released in March 2020, and he often livestreamed from Instagram and performed songs acoustically for his fans during the pandemic. Niall’s fourth single “Black & White” was released in April 2020 and was reportedly his all time favorite song from his own discography.
