                <p>
                        Harry Edward Styles was born on February 1st, 1994 in Holmes Chapel, United Kingdom to Anne Cox and Desmond ‘Des’ Styles. Harry immersed himself in music at a young age and was lead singer in a high school band called White Eskimo. In 2010, he left home at sixteen to compete in the seventh season of The X Factor, singing Stevie Wonder’s “Isn't She Lovely” and Oasis’ “Stop Crying Your Heart Out”. Although he was cut before finals, judges Simon Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger grouped Harry with four other competitors - Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, and Louis Tomlinson - to finish off the competition as a new group called One Direction. Harry went on to enjoy immense success with One Direction, releasing five albums from 2011 to 2015 and hitting number one multiple times across the globe before parting for an indefinite hiatus in 2016. Months later, Harry signed a solo deal as his music took a more rock-based and serious approach, while maintaining the pop style his 1D fans desired. “Sign of the Times” was released as Harry’s first single in 2017, which quickly rose to the top of the charts in Europe, and was followed by the rest of the album “Harry Styles” later that year. Harry also made his feature film debut in Oscar-winning Dunkirk, which made him the first British artist to win a number one debut single, album, and film in the same year. He then embarked on a world tour from September 2017 to July 2018, and released his second album, Fine Line, in 2019. Fine Line, which included influences as varied as Childish Gambino-styled funk to Bon Iver folk, was a number one Billboard 200 entry and contained his first No. 1 single, “Watermelon Sugar”. Harry then embarked on another world tour.
