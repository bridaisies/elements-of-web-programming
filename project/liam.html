                <p>
                        Liam James Payne was born on August 29th, 1993 in Wolverhampton, England to Geoff and Karen Payne. After discovering his talent for singing at the age of twelve, he joined Pink Productions, a performing arts company, and later studied music technology at the City of Wolverhampton College. In 2008, Liam auditioned for The X Factor and was told by judge Simon Cowell to audition again when older. Following Cowell’s advice, Liam auditioned again in 2010, performing Justin Timberlake’s “Cry Me a River”. Although he was rejected as a solo artist, judges Simon Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger grouped Liam with four other competitors - Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, and Louis Tomlinson - to finish off the competition as a new group called One Direction. Liam went on to enjoy immense success with One Direction, releasing five albums from 2011 to 2015 and hitting number one multiple times across the globe before parting for an indefinite hiatus in 2016. He later signed a solo record contract with Capitol Records, and released his debut single “Strip That Down” in 2017, which was a worldwide chart success. Liam then released four more singles that year: “Bedroom Floor”, “For You”, “Get Low”, and “Familiar”. In August of 2018, he released a collaborative single called “Polaroid” with Jonas Blue and Lennon Stella, and served as a celebrity guest judge for ex-band-member Louis Tomlinson on The X Factor. LP1, his debut album, was released in December of 2019 and received mixed reviews as well as backlash. Most recently, Liam participated in Lady Gaga’s #TogetherAtHome concert and began vlogging to update his fans.
