                <h1>Zayn Malik</h1>
                <p>
                        Zayn Javadd Malik was born January 12, 1993 in Bradford, England to Yaser and Patricia Malik. In 2010, at 17 years old, Zayn auditioned for the seventh series of The X Factor with “Let Me Love You” by Mario. Although he was rejected as a solo artist, judges Simon Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger grouped Zayn with four other competitors - Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles, and Liam Payne - to finish off the competition as a new group called One Direction. Zayn went on to enjoy immense success with One Direction, releasing five albums from 2011 to 2015 and hitting number one multiple times across the globe. In 2015, Zayn permanently departed from the band because of his desire for a private life. The rest of his former band members confirmed that Zayn was unhappy for a while, having only continued to stay in the band for his fans. Zayn then officially signed with RCA Recordsa as a solo artist, and released his debut single, “Pillowtalk”, which debuted #1 on iTunes, making Zayn only one of the two male artist to debut at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2016. His debut album Mind of Mine was released a year to the day he left One Direction, and Zayn became the first UK male artist to debut at #1 in the US and UK. In December 2018, Zayn’s second album “Icarus Falls” was released, and in 2019, he collaborated with Zhavia Ward on a cover of the Aladdin theme song “A Whole New World”. The single was very well received, obtaining over 10 million views on YouTube in two days.
